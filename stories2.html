          <p class="card__body">When we first met him, Finley had been described as a shy cat. Since moving in with us,
              Finley has shown a cheekier side - he's always up for some mischief. He's exactly what our
              family was looking for!</p>

                imagine coming home not to find her. Adopting a kitten was the best decision we've ever made! </p>

                        now enjoying the company of his new parents and being able to explore the garden. What a character!</p>

              <p class="card__body">Winnie is a softie, and loves to stay in our laps everytime he can. We were scared of how
                he would get along with our dog but they are now partners in crime!</p>
