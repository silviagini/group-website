      <p1> Milo is a 4-year-old affectionate fur ball. He was adopted 6 months ago and is
      now enjoying the company of his new parents and being able to explore the garden while chasing
      squirrels. What a character! <p1>

    <h2> Lou </h2>

      <p2> Lou was rehomed one year ago and has been the queen of the house since then. She enjoys
          cuddles, cardboard boxes and laser pointers. We can't imagine living without her! </p2>

    <h3> Finley </h3>

      <p3> When we first met him, Finley had been described as a shy cat. Since moving in with us,
          Finley has shown a cheekier side - he's always up for some mischief. He's exactly what our
          family was looking for! </p3>

    <h4> Cosmo </h4>

      <p4> Cosmo has been an absolute joy in our lives. He's affectionate, cuddly, and loves to play
        with our children. We're so thankful to have him in our lives! </p4>
