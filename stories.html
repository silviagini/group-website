        <h1> Milo </h2>
            <div><img src="images/milo2.jpg" alt="Milo the cat" class="image"></div>
                <p1> Milo is a 4-year-old affectionate fur ball. He was adopted 6 months ago and is
                  now enjoying the company of his new parents and being able to explore the garden while chasing
                  squirrels. What a character! </p1>

          <h2> Lou </h2>
          <div><img src="images/lou.jpg" alt="Lou the cat" class="image"></div>
          <p2> Lou was rehomed one year ago and has been the queen of the house since then. She enjoys
                    cuddles, cardboard boxes and laser pointers. We can't imagine living without her! </p2>

      <h3> Finley </h3>
      <div><img src="images/finley.jpg" alt="Finley the cat" class="image"></div>
        <p3> When we first met him, Finley had been described as a shy cat. Since moving in with us,
            Finley has shown a cheekier side - he's always up for some mischief. He's exactly what our
            family was looking for! </p3>

    <h4> Cosmo </h4>
      <div><img src="images/cosmo2.jpg" alt="Cosmo the cat" class="image"></div>
        <p4> Cosmo has been an absolute joy in our lives. He's affectionate, cuddly, and loves to play
          with our children. We're so thankful to have him in our lives! </p4>
